Simple plugin that adds a color picker button next to the colors defined in your code.

> [!NOTE]
> You can normally just right click on a color constructor and click on "Pick Color" to pick a color in the script editor. This plugin just makes it easier.

# Installation
Either clone this repository or download it as zip, then put the `inline-color-picker` folder into your `res://addons/` folder. If you don't have an `addons` folder, you can create it yourself.

# Usage
Enabling the plugin should be enough.
